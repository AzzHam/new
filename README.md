This is my first attempt to develope an industrial informatics pyramid (based on ISA-95) using Node.JS 
as a student project for FIS course in TUT. I have developed ERP, MES, SCADA, and Warehouse management
system. these systems communicating to each other through RESTful APIs. I used Express.JS to develope 
the RESTful API and a bunch of other modules to make it work.
